  //This describes Property Driven Testing in scalatest using ScalaTest style
  //This approeach is known as Generator-driven property checks
  //There exist as well ScalaCheck-style - if interested read http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/writing_scalacheck_style_properties


  //You can marriage scalatest and scalacheck extending PropertyChecks trait
  //Thanks to that 'forAll' functions are here and they allow you to run Prop objects from scalacheck library
  //Advantage is that they are nicely reported and automatically picked up when tests run (is sbt for example)

  //Disadvantage is that part of PropertyChecks is generated though it's hard to read its methods signatures.
  //Use intellij ctrl+f12 or ctrl+q and look for methods 'forAll[A](...) to see what they are
  //Or read below extracted signatures:


  new {

    //Below methods will create and run scalacheck.Props in one step

    //in body of these methods use normal scalatest matchers
    //they will throw exceptions as usual and scalatest will handle all of them for you
    //read http://doc.scalatest.org/3.0.0/#org.scalatest.prop.GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks
